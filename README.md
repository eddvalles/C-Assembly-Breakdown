# C Programming and Windows Executable Analysis – From Source Code to Assembly

This repository showcases hands-on C development and low-level analysis of Windows executables. Each project demonstrates direct compilation with `gcc`, followed by disassembly and inspection.

## 🛠 Toolchain
- **C (ISO/ANSI standard)** – Low-level systems programming
- **GCC (MinGW-w64, UCRT)** – Native Windows compilation
  
- **Visual Studio Code** – Code editing and Git integration

- **IDA** – Interactive disassembly and control flow analysis
- **x64dbg** – Dynamic debugger for Windows executables
- **PEStudio** – Static PE file analysis and behavioral indicators
- 
- **FLARE VM** – Malware analysis environment with built-in RE tools
- 
- **PowerShell / Git Bash** – Build, run, and disassemble from the command line
